I am an AI / ML consultant with four years of experience in data science, machine learning engineering, and generative AI.  
My expertise includes large language models, MLOps and LLMOps, predictive modelling, econometrics, and applied data analysis across commercial and operational environments.

Currently, I'm focused on developing production-grade LLMOps systems, including financial assistant chatbots and other deployable real-world AI applications.

My background includes experience across several high-impact analytical roles, including data science work in production and operations, econometric modelling, forecasting, and the development of machine-learning solutions for business decision-making. I have worked extensively with Python, ML frameworks, cloud-based architectures, and the design of robust, scalable AI pipelines.
